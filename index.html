      <p>Welcome to my little Blackjack application!</p>
      <p>
        It won't fool anyone into thinking they're in Las Vegas, it doesn't even
        contain most of the features you'd expect, it's just a simple project to
        illustrate my learning and progression in web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rules are simple; hit 'New Game' to play, 'Hit' to get another card
        and 'Stand' to let the Dealer take over. Remember, you're playing to
        beat the dealer without exceeding 21.
      </p>
      <p>Good luck!</p>
